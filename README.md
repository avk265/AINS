AINS HOSPITAL WEBSITE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
- ABSTRACT
  
The AINS Hospital Website Management System is a web-based application developed to
simplify and modernize the hospital appointment and consultation process. The objective of the
project is to create an efficient platform for patients to book appointments, manage consultation
histories, and track their real-time consultation status. The system allows a single user account to
handle multiple patient profiles, making it convenient for families to manage healthcare
collectively.
The scope of the project includes appointment booking, doctor consultation tracking, token
queue management, and administrative control over doctor records and appointments. The
methodology involves designing a user-friendly interface with secure login, dynamic
appointment modules, and a real-time token update system managed by doctors. Administrators
can manage doctor profiles and view appointments filtered by date or patient. Doctors can update
the consultation status of each patient, which reflects in the patient's history, offering
transparency and organized record-keeping.
Key findings include reduced manual effort in appointment scheduling, improved patient-doctor
coordination, and enhanced user satisfaction through digital healthcare access. The system is
currently built for a single hospital with one admin, but it is designed to be scalable for future
multi-admin and multi-hospital extensions, contributing to a more efficient and transparent
healthcare delivery process.

- OBJECTIVES

Key objectives include:
1. Patient Account Management: Allow users to register and manage multiple patient
profiles under a single account, simplifying family healthcare tracking.
2. Online Appointment Booking: Enable patients to book appointments with doctors
through an intuitive interface, selecting date, time, and relevant details.
3. Real-Time Token System: Implement a live token tracking mechanism so that patients
are aware of their position in the consultation queue and the current status of ongoing
appointments.
4. Consultation History: Maintain detailed historical records of each patientâ€™s
appointments and their consultation status.
5. Doctor Dashboard: Allow doctors to view scheduled appointments, mark patients as
consulted, and update real-time data.
6. Admin Control: Provide a robust admin panel for managing doctor profiles, editing
details, and reviewing appointment history based on date or patient.
